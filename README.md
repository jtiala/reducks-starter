In order to use this boilerplate, you'll need to clone this repo. If you don't know how to clone a repository, follow this [Link](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
After you've sucessfully cloned the repo, navigate to the root of the repo folder using a terminal.
Execute the following command:

```
yarn
```

- You don't need to specify yarn install due to the fact that the `yarn` command is equal to `yarn install`.

After it's done loading, simply execute npm start and navigate to localhost:8080
